Before you get started translating, there are a few things you should know.

General Considerations:
1. You translate what's on the RIGHT side in the .php files.
2. .php files are just .txt files with a different extension, you can open them in any text editor.
3. Some texts are omitted from the files, such as Terms of Service, for legal reasons. Image buttons are also
   omitted for now, but will likely be added for translation later.
4. If you have any trouble, you can contact us at "translators@dischan.org".
5. If you don't understand git, you can send your translations to the above email, however it is preferred
   that you learn how to use it. Github has many excellent tutorials and help pages on their site: https://help.github.com/
6. You don't have to translate absolutely everything, even partial translations are appreciated.
7. Capitalization should be maintained, if applicable to your language

Setting up for a new language:
If you are translating into a new langauge, copy the contents of the EN directory, and rename it to the two character
language code that you are translating to (ex. DE for German, ES for spanish, etc.). If you do not know the code,
you can usually find it from searching your language on Wikipedia.

If you come across something you cannot or do not want to translate, simply leave the English version there. Do not erase or
leave anything blank.

Conclusion:
That's everything. Those of us at Dischan thank you for your help, and happy translating!
